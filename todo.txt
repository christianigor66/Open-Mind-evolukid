Not expected result? One of the reason could be not enough example images
want to integrate this kind of feature? see the starter template or use this
facing bug/issues, create a github issue here
not the result you expected, view the application on github
 about- this project is part of cluster-11 organization
view a similar application from google teachable machine
remove console.log
use teachable machine show result css
show good job when they add more images
show clear all example in a dropdown beside the button
clear all previous examples, cross button, popup modal
how this application works, a short message, we don't save your images, all training happens on the browser,     Try to give as much example image as possible to get the best
 possible outcome
            You didn't add any example image to train the model. You have to
provide example images, so the machine learning model gets enough
data to understand the difference between your two image classes and
prepare the result.
This is a open source project
